# Overview

The downverse is a set of packages that are centered around converting R Markdown documents into many static and dynamic output formats, including HTML, PDF, papers, posters, presentations, and more. The getdown package is designed to make it easy to get packages in the downverse.

If youâ€™d like to learn how to use the downverse effectively, the best place to start is the [R Markdown Gallery](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html).

## Installation

getdown is not yet available on CRAN but you can install the GitHub version:

``` r
# install.packages("pkg")
pkg::pkg_install("ellisvalentiner/getdown")
```

## Usage

`library(getdown)` will load the following packages:

* [rmarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown), for general R Markdown and HTML, PDF, MS Word documents and Beamer, ioslides, and Slidy presentations
* [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), for creating blogs and websites
* [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown), for authoring books and technical documents
* [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown), for creating paged HTML documents (resumes) for printing
* [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown), for generating static html documentation for R packages
* [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown), for generating conference posters
* [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), for creating slideshows with remark.js and R Markdown

However you will probably not want to load all of these packages at once. Instead you may want to simply use getdown to install all of the downverse packages.
